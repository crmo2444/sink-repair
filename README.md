# sink-repair
Short and sweet intro into fetch/APIs/json... This application is for Maude and Merle's Sink Repair/Plumming service. They are able to show it to customers, where customers can then input any service requests they may have. Maude and Merle can then see any service requests made, delete them if they don't want to complete the service, or mark them as completed with their name.
